For the rule set (x5 > 0.516263216733932, x2 <= 0.689961671829224)...
Discipline 1 would go from 23.04% to 3.53% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 23.04% to 3.53% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 23.04% to 3.53% of its original design space remaining!
