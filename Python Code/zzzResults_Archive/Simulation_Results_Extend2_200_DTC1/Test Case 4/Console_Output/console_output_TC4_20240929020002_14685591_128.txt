For the rule set (x2 <= 0.408402547240257, x5 > 0.572393238544464)...
Discipline 1 would go from 17.05% to 0.44% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 17.05% to 0.44% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 17.05% to 0.44% of its original design space remaining!
