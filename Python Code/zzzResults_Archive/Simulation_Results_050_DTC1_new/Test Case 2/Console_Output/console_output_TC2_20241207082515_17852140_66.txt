Discipline 1 would go from 26.03% to 4.55% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 66.74% to 66.74% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 31.61% to 19.32% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x2 <= 0.78993421792984, x1 > 0.516130357980728): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 2.738203201787675, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 127.43328061181698, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
