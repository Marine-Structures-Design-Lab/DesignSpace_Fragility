Universally proposed input rules: [x5 <= 0.61812150478363]
For the rule set (x5 <= 0.61812150478363, x4 <= 0.729658991098404)...
Discipline 1 would go from 11.16% to 11.16% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 40.91% to 16.53% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 8.11% to 4.51% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x5 <= 0.61812150478363, x4 <= 0.729658991098404): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': -0.12703965489906843, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 1.67167149781855, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
