For the rule set (x1 <= 0.79088944196701, x5 > 0.128541428595781)...
Discipline 1 would go from 12.4% to 9.58% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 7.44% to 3.72% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 27.27% to 10.54% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x1 <= 0.79088944196701, x5 > 0.128541428595781): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.6800745862886762, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 1.4546190487878035, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 116.12524428558443, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
