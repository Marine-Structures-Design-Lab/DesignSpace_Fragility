Universally proposed input rules: [x4 <= 0.495221897959709, x5 > 0.490192696452141]
For the rule set (x4 <= 0.495221897959709, x5 > 0.490192696452141)...
Discipline 1 would go from 20.45% to 20.45% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 34.09% to 4.55% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 27.89% to 7.44% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x4 <= 0.495221897959709, x5 > 0.490192696452141): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 17.856312932582533, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 4.552531373984921, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
Final input rules after fragility check: [x4 <= 0.495221897959709, x5 > 0.490192696452141]
