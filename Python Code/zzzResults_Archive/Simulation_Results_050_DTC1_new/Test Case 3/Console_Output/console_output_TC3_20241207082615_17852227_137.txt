For the rule set (x4 <= 0.439233124256134, x1 > 0.527309685945511, x3 <= 0.875604689121246, x5 > 0.452159956097603, x4 <= 0.817176848649979, x1 > 0.613805294036865, x5 <= 0.908241450786591, x2 <= 0.459807738661766)...
Discipline 1 would go from 27.27% to 16.06% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 100.0% to 17.84% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 54.55% to 18.6% of its original design space remaining!
