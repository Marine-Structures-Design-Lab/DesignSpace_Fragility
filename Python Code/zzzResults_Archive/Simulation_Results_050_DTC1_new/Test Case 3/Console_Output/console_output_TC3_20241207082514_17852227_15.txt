Universally proposed input rules: [x1 > 0.393357932567596]
For the rule set (x1 > 0.393357932567596, x5 <= 0.811901211738586, x4 <= 0.335637301206589, x1 <= 0.512736618518829)...
Discipline 1 would go from 50.0% to 4.55% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 50.0% to 14.88% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 100.0% to 7.44% of its original design space remaining!
