For the rule set (x1 <= 0.225192777812481, x1 <= 0.364181026816368, x3 <= 0.865582406520844)...
Discipline 1 would go from 14.88% to 2.14% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 16.53% to 14.27% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 6.2% to 1.03% of its original design space remaining!
