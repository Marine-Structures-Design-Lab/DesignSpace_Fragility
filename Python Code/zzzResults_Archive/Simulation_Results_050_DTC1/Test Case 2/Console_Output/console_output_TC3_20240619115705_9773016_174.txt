Discipline 1 would go from 18.41% to 11.83% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.12 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.1 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 15.78% to 2.03% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 4.24 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.79 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 30.99% to 6.2% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has -0.44 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.77 added potential for windfall.
