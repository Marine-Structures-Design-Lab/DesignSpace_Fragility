For the rule set (x5 > 0.481297329068184, x1 > 0.0705401711165905)...
Discipline 1 would go from 13.13% to 2.39% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 13.13% to 2.39% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 13.13% to 2.39% of its original design space remaining!
