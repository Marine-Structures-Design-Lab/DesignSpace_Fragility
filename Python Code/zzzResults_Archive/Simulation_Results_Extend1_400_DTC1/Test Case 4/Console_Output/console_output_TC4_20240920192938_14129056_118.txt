For the rule set (x4 > 0.634692758321762, x1 > 0.107879124581814)...
Discipline 1 would go from 12.43% to 3.53% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 12.43% to 3.53% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 12.43% to 3.53% of its original design space remaining!
