For the rule set (x5 > 0.721001327037811, x2 <= 0.843980252742767)...
Discipline 1 would go from 7.17% to 3.23% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 7.17% to 3.23% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 7.17% to 3.23% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x5 > 0.721001327037811, x2 <= 0.843980252742767): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': -0.23096798206850988, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1,)}, 1: {'value': -1.750389105003598, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1,)}, 2: {'value': 0.47166958707391804, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1,)}}}
