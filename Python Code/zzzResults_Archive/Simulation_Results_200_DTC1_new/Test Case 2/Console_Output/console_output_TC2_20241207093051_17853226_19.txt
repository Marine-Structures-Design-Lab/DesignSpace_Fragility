Universally proposed input rules: [x5 <= 0.575337320566177]
For the rule set (x5 <= 0.575337320566177,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 8.68% to 8.68% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 6.2% to 2.48% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 11.36% to 4.55% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x5 <= 0.575337320566177,): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 1.633962690979769, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': -0.7155956251197144, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
