Universally proposed input rules: [x5 > 0.535087049007416]
For the rule set (x5 > 0.535087049007416,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 7.75% to 7.75% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 3.51% to 1.76% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 6.2% to 3.1% of its original design space remaining!
