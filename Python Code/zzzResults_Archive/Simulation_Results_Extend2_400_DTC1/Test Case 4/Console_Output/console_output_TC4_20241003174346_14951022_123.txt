For the rule set (x2 <= 0.64838033914566, x5 > 0.601584613323212)...
Discipline 1 would go from 15.92% to 5.83% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 15.92% to 5.83% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 15.92% to 5.83% of its original design space remaining!
