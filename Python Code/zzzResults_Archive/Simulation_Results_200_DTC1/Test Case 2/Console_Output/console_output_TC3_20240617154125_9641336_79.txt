For the rule set (x3 <= 0.113035660237074,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 5.27% to 1.76% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.25 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.18 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 0.96% to 0.32% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has -0.68 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 34.13 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 4.55% to 4.55% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
