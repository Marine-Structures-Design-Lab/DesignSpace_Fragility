For the rule set (x2 <= 0.593795850872993, x5 <= 0.883883953094482)...
Discipline 1 would go from 32.12% to 21.98% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 37.19% to 29.75% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 29.58% to 23.67% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x2 <= 0.593795850872993, x5 <= 0.883883953094482): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.5544778480450813, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 1.0205339048068778, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': -0.2601186404350526, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
