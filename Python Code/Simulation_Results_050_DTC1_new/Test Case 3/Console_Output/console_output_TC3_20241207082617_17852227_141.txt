For the rule set (x3 <= 0.721161156892776, x4 <= 0.572614252567291)...
Discipline 1 would go from 19.23% to 12.02% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 29.75% to 10.33% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 56.2% to 56.2% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x3 <= 0.721161156892776, x4 <= 0.572614252567291): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 2.1478162172174544, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 5.036358609420303, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
