For the rule set (x5 <= 0.716543912887573, x4 <= 0.428250446915627, x3 <= 0.422202840447426)...
Discipline 1 would go from 9.09% to 3.72% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 81.82% to 9.13% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 7.44% to 4.96% of its original design space remaining!
