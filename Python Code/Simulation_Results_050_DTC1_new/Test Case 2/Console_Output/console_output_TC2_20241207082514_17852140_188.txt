Discipline 1 would go from 27.89% to 9.13% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 7.44% to 7.44% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 12.4% to 7.44% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x2 <= 0.531453683972359, x1 <= 0.738536387681961): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.48210195553517565, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': -0.4041240925022682, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
