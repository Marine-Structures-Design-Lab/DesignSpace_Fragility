For the rule set (x4 <= 0.530354648828506, x1 <= 0.895230084657669)...
Discipline 1 would go from 21.49% to 15.63% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 6.61% to 6.61% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 50.0% to 36.36% of its original design space remaining!
