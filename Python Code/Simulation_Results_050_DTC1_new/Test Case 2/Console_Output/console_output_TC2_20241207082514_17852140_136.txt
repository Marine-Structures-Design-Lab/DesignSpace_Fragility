For the rule set (x3 <= 0.307718321681023, x5 > 0.569977730512619)...
Discipline 1 would go from 59.5% to 11.16% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 7.66% to 0.85% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 63.22% to 37.19% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x3 <= 0.307718321681023, x5 > 0.569977730512619): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.5436505941393796, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 0.44169882771918734, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 0.30493663725292186, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
