DESCRIPTION:
Main script file for simulating the space reduction process of a convergent
design approach (geared towards Set-Based Design).  In this file, a design
problem is presented with various discipline's and design variables.  An
automated process is established to explore and propose reductions for each
discipline's design space, and then the design manager merges these proposed
reductions among interdependent disciplines with the goal of converging on a
final, optimal design.

The design manager has the option to call on a fragility framework to analyze
the vulnerability of remaining design spaces before committing to a reduction
decision.  This script file can call on this framework while also importing
classes and functions to make this set-based design and fragility assessment
process as modular as possible for various design problems.

This script is currently coded to handle the Set-Based Design problem involving
three disciplines and various mathematical equations as described in the
prospectus document that can be accessed through the link provided in this
repository's README file.
