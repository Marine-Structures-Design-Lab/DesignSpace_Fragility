For the rule set (x3 > 0.506605982780457, x2 <= 0.97119215130806)...
Discipline 1 would go from 8.79% to 0.68% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.27 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.22 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 14.2% to 1.18% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.09 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.08 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 3.16% to 3.16% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
