Universally proposed input rules: [x5 > 0.569300949573517]
For the rule set (x5 > 0.569300949573517,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 8.54% to 2.81% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.1 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.17 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 8.54% to 2.81% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.5 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.47 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 8.54% to 2.81% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.15 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.18 added potential for windfall.
