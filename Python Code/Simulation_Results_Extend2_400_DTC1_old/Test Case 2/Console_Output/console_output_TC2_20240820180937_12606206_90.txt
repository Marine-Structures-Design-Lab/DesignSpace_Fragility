For the rule set (x2 <= 0.761051952838898,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 6.47% to 5.04% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has -0.2 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has 0.42 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 6.47% to 5.04% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has -0.16 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 0.34 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 6.47% to 5.04% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.21 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.25 added potential for windfall.
