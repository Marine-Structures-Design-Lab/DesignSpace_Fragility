For the rule set (x5 > 0.397640079259872, x2 <= 0.428975716233253)...
Discipline 1 would go from 27.33% to 0.88% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 27.33% to 0.88% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 27.33% to 0.88% of its original design space remaining!
