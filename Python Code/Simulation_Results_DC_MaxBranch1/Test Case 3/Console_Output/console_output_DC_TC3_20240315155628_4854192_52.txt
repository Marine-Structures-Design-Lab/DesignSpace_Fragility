For the rule set (x2 <= 0.503289371728897,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 6.09% to 5.07% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.16 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.1 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 1.27% to 1.27% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has -1.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 2.48% to 2.48% of its original design space remaining!
