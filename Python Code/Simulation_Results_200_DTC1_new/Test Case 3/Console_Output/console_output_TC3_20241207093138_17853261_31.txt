For the rule set (x3 > 0.479123219847679, x4 <= 0.610409379005432, x3 <= 0.60516881942749)...
Discipline 1 would go from 4.4% to 0.68% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 16.6% to 1.95% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 4.96% to 4.96% of its original design space remaining!
