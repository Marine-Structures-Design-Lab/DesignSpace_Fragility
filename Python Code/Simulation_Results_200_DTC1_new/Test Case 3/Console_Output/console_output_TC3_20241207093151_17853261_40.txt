For the rule set (x5 <= 0.70506152510643, x4 <= 0.594815403223038)...
Discipline 1 would go from 6.59% to 6.59% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 9.64% to 4.4% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 11.72% to 7.81% of its original design space remaining!
