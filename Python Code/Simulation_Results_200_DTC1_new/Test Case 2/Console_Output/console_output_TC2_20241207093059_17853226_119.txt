Discipline 1 would go from 2.69% to 2.69% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 5.49% to 4.76% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 6.82% to 6.82% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x4 <= 0.575571417808533,): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 3.655517554657095e-06, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
Final input rules after fragility check: [x4 <= 0.575571417808533]
