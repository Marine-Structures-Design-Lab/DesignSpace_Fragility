Discipline 1 would go from 9.92% to 3.72% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 3.38% to 3.38% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 13.52% to 10.14% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x2 <= 0.483570724725723, x1 <= 0.684965997934341): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': 0.0058009214206861115, 'threshold': 126.83602730566628, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3)}, 1: {'value': 0.0, 'threshold': 43.23955476329533, 'sub-space': (x3, x4, x5)}, 2: {'value': -0.3688266825058377, 'threshold': 172.95821905318132, 'sub-space': (x1, x5, x6)}}}
