For the rule set (x1 <= 0.824949264526367, x1 > 0.5075324177742)...
Discipline 1 would go from 11.16% to 6.51% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 2.2% to 2.2% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 4.96% to 2.89% of its original design space remaining!
