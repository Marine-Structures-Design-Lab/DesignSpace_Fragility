SUMMARY:
Calculate the uncertainty of the remaining design space as defined by the set
of rules passed to this class according to the points that have been calculated
in each discipline's design space.  Consider calculating the uncertainty of
both the input and output spaces.  Have the finished product be some sort of
entropy uncertainty map.  Consider also adding a method that visualizes the
uncertainty either in a table or graph form if possible.
