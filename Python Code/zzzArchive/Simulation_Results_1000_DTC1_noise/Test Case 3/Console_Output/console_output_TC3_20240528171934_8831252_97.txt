Discipline 1 would go from 5.63% to 4.88% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.22 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.12 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 3.19% to 3.19% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 12.4% to 10.74% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.01 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.01 added potential for windfall.
