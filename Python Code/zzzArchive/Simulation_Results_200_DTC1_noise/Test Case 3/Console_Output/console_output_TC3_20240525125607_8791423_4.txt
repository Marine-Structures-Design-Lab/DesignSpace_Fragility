For the rule set (x1 <= 0.688033610582352,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 5.58% to 4.06% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has -0.1 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has 0.22 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 3.61% to 3.61% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 5.37% to 3.91% of its original design space remaining!
