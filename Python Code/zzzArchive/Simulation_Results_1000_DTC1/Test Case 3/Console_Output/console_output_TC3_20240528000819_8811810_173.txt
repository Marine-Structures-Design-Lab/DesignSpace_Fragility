For the rule set (x2 <= 0.405968114733696, x5 > 0.51959028840065)...
Discipline 1 would go from 5.63% to 4.51% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.22 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.28 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 2.03% to 2.03% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 6.2% to 6.2% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
