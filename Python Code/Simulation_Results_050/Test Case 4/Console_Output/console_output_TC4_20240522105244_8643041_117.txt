For the rule set (x3 <= 0.607323884963989, (x3 <= 0.35283899307251) | (x3 > 0.554056107997894), x5 <= 0.549784034490585, x2 > 0.124459009617567)...
Discipline 1 would go from 24.8% to 6.14% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.11 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.13 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 86.36% to 14.88% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 3.44 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.75 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 45.45% to 24.79% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 1.06 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.12 added potential for windfall.
