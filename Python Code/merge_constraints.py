    ### One option is to have the requests pop up with stats and I decide
    ### Or program decides with stats
    ### Stats: How many disciplines are requesting what vs. the other
    ### How each side would be affected by the other discipline's proposal
    
    
    ### Could call a getInput method here...but not have it be a uniform method
    ### Could also do this for the fragility or other methods that may need to
