For the rule set (x5 > 0.423070281744003, x4 <= 0.339536800980568)...
Discipline 1 would go from 30.72% to 4.05% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 30.72% to 4.05% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 30.72% to 4.05% of its original design space remaining!
