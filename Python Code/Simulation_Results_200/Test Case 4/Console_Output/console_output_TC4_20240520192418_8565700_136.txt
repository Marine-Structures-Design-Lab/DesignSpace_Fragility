Discipline 1 would go from 7.64% to 7.64% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 6.25% to 4.75% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.05 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.03 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 8.1% to 5.82% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 4.1 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.44 added potential for windfall.
