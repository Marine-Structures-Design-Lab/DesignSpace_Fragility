For the rule set (x6 <= 0.52536529302597, x3 <= 0.787134945392609)...
Discipline 1 would go from 5.95% to 1.93% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 5.95% to 1.93% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 5.95% to 1.93% of its original design space remaining!
