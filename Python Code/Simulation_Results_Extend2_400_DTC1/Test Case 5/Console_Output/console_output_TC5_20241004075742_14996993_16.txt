For the rule set (x5 > 0.585077434778214, x5 > 0.590753942728043)...
Discipline 1 would go from 7.63% to 2.72% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 7.63% to 2.72% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 7.63% to 2.72% of its original design space remaining!
