For the rule set (x5 > 0.51546385884285, x6 <= 0.717596828937531)...
Discipline 1 would go from 12.76% to 3.89% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 12.76% to 3.89% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 12.76% to 3.89% of its original design space remaining!
