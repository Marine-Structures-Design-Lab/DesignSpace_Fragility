For the rule set (x5 > 0.321680933237076, x2 <= 0.339486762881279)...
Discipline 1 would go from 14.06% to 3.09% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 14.06% to 3.09% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 14.06% to 3.09% of its original design space remaining!
