Universally proposed input rules: [x3 <= 0.681303769350052]
For the rule set (x3 <= 0.681303769350052, x5 > 0.502785593271255)...
Discipline 1 would go from 31.46% to 0.91% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 31.46% to 0.91% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 31.46% to 0.91% of its original design space remaining!
