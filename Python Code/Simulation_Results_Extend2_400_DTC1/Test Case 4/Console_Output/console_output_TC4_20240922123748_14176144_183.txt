For the rule set (x5 > 0.719617068767548, x5 > 0.477580279111862)...
Discipline 1 would go from 27.33% to 3.6% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 27.33% to 3.6% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 27.33% to 3.6% of its original design space remaining!
