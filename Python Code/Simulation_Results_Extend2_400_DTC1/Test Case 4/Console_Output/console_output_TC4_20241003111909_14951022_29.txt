Opinions: {x5 > 0.763224303722382: array([0.2607088 , 0.36491073, 0.27632626])}
Universally proposed input rules: [x5 > 0.763224303722382]
For the rule set (x5 > 0.763224303722382,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 5.04% to 1.11% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 5.04% to 1.11% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 5.04% to 1.11% of its original design space remaining!
Fragility assessment: {(x5 > 0.763224303722382,): {'fragile': False, 0: {'value': -0.7053303866881365, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)}, 1: {'value': -7.124946521096858, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)}, 2: {'value': -6.8391965627003275, 'threshold': inf, 'sub-space': (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)}}}
