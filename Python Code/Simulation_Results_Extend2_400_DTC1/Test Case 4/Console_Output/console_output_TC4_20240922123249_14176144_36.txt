For the rule set (x2 <= 0.684574633836746, x5 > 0.651894360780716)...
Discipline 1 would go from 27.41% to 3.15% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 27.41% to 3.15% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 27.41% to 3.15% of its original design space remaining!
