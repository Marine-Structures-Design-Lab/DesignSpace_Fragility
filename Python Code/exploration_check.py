"""
SUMMARY:
Contains methods with different strategies for checking a design space and
determining an automated point in time for either one or several disciplines
to propose a space reduction before the fragility framework has the option to
come into play.

i.e. amount of time...space covered...changes in feedback...adaptive sampling threshold
met...LHS complete...etc.
