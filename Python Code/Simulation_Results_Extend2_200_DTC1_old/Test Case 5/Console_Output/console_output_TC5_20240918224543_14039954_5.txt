For the rule set (x4 <= 0.579988807439804, x6 <= 0.30402147769928)...
Discipline 1 would go from 10.72% to 3.57% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 10.72% to 3.57% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 10.72% to 3.57% of its original design space remaining!
