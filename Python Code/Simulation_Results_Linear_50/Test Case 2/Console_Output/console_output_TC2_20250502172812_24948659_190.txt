For the rule set (x2 <= 0.532593041658401, x2 <= 0.679425239562988)...
Discipline 1 would go from 10.72% to 3.84% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 10.72% to 3.84% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 10.72% to 3.84% of its original design space remaining!
