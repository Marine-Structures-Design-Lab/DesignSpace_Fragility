For the rule set (x1 <= 0.769868344068527, x1 > 0.428129613399506)...
Discipline 1 would go from 9.91% to 4.43% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 would go from 9.91% to 4.43% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 would go from 9.91% to 4.43% of its original design space remaining!
