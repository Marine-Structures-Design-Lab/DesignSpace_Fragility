For the rule set (x2 <= 0.574450194835663, x6 <= 0.767743140459061)...
Discipline 1 would go from 33.06% to 19.53% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.01 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.02 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 9.92% to 9.92% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 24.79% to 19.16% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.59 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.22 added potential for windfall.
