For the rule set (x6 > 0.83372175693512, x3 <= 0.358299523591995)...
Discipline 1 would go from 29.75% to 14.88% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.07 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.07 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 16.53% to 8.26% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.85 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.23 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 7.23% to 4.13% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has -0.26 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.7 added potential for windfall.
