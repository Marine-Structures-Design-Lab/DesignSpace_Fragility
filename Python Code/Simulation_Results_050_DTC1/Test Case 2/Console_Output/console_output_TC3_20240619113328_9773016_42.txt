For the rule set (x4 > 0.172528384253383, x1 <= 0.184174261987209)...
Discipline 1 would go from 6.31% to 3.16% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 2.74 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.36 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 27.48% to 22.48% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.31 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.09 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 31.4% to 15.7% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.23 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.16 added potential for windfall.
