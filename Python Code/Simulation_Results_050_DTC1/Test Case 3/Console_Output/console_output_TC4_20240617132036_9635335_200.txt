For the rule set (x3 <= 0.318780161440372, x3 <= 0.565954566001892)...
Discipline 1 would go from 27.48% to 8.74% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.77 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.42 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 27.27% to 8.68% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 5.57 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.66 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 31.82% to 31.82% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
