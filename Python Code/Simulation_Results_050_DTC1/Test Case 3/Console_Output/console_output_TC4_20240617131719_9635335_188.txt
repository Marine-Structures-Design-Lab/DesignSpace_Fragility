Discipline 1 has 0.47 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.48 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 86.36% to 43.18% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 2.66 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.3 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 35.12% to 17.56% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has -0.37 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 65.34 added potential for windfall.
