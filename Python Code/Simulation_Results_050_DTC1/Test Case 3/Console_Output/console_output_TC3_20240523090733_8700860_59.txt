For the rule set (x6 > 0.516682326793671, x3 <= 0.691886961460114)...
Discipline 1 would go from 24.59% to 21.69% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.3 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.1 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 17.56% to 15.5% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.2 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.04 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 11.36% to 5.68% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.04 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.06 added potential for windfall.
