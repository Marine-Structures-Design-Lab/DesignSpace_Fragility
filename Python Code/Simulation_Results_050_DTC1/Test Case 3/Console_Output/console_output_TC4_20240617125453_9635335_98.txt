For the rule set (x3 <= 0.314705610275269, x6 <= 0.650214612483978)...
Discipline 1 would go from 16.76% to 7.82% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has -0.42 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has 1.25 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 40.29% to 18.8% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 8.53 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.44 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 45.66% to 29.06% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.23 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.51 added potential for windfall.
