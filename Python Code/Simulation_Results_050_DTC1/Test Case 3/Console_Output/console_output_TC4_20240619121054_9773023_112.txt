For the rule set (x3 > 0.0683382786810398, x1 <= 0.696384906768799)...
Discipline 1 would go from 14.46% to 3.55% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 2.06 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.77 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 22.73% to 18.6% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.13 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.08 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 20.66% to 6.2% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.27 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.22 added potential for windfall.
