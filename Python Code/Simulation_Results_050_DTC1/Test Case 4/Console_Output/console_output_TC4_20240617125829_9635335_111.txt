Discipline 1 would go from 24.79% to 11.18% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.26 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.21 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 6.2% to 0.94% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 53.59 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.81 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 100.0% to 17.56% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 2.43 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has -0.68 added potential for windfall.
