For the rule set (x4 <= 0.550565898418427,)...
Discipline 1 would go from 29.58% to 29.58% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 52.69% to 28.74% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 4.44 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.48 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 26.34% to 26.34% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
