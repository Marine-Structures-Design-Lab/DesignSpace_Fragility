Discipline 1 has 1.06 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.55 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 16.48% to 7.69% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 0.19 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.07 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 10.65% to 10.65% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
