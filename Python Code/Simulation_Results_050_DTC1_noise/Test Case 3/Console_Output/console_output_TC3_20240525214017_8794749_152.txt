For the rule set (x1 > 0.425761699676514, x3 <= 0.393141120672226)...
Discipline 1 would go from 11.96% to 7.69% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 1 has 0.28 added potential for regret.
Discipline 1 has -0.19 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 2 would go from 37.6% to 24.17% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 2 has 4.65 added potential for regret.
Discipline 2 has -0.26 added potential for windfall.
Discipline 3 would go from 18.8% to 18.8% of its original design space remaining!
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for regret.
Discipline 3 has 0.0 added potential for windfall.
