# DesignSpace_Fragility

This repository is used to emulate Set-Based Design (SBD) exploration and reduction decisions of a provided SBD-problem so that a fragility framework can be built and tested to assess the vulnerability of emergent design spaces to new information.  Within the Python Code folder, there is a series of different files containing functions and methods used by the main 'script.py' file.  There are also accompanying unit test files where necessary.  The 'File_Tracker.xlsx' file keeps track of each one of these supporting python files and notes which of their functions and methods have completed unit tests.  The 'SBD_Simulation.pdf' file provides a visual of how the main 'script.py' file operates.  There is also a 'zzzArchive' folder containing code within files not used as part of the completed SBD simulation and fragility framework, but code that may still be useful moving forward.
