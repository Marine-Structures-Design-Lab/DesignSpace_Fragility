# DesignSpace_Fragility

This repository is used to emulate Set-Based Design (SBD) exploration and reduction decisions of a provided SBD-problem so that a fragility framework can be built and tested to assess the vulnerability of emergent design spaces to new information.  Within the Python Code folder, there is a series of different files containing functions and methods used by the main 'script.py' file.  There are also accompanying unit test files where necessary.  The 'File_Tracker.xlsx' file keeps track of each one of these supporting python files and notes which of their functions and methods have completed unit tests.  The 'IMDC_SBD_Simulation.pdf' file provides a visual of how the main 'script.py' file operates as part of its submission for the 2024 International Marine Design Conference (IMDC).  There is also a 'zzzArchive' folder containing code within files not used as part of the completed SBD simulation and fragility framework, but code that may still be useful moving forward.  There is also a 'Simulation Results' folder.  This folder contains all of the simulations' final results for 4 different test cases run as part of the submission for the IMDC conference paper.  Each test case corresponds to the script files 'scriptTC1.py', 'scriptTC2.py', 'scriptTC3.py', and 'scriptTC4.py'.  For any correspondence relevant to this code or supporting papers, please reach out to the main author, Joseph Van Houten, at joeyvan@umich.edu.
